### Source Code

Here is a project for the advanced geeks around PSC here. I ran into some of the most major modals I have ever seen in the entire time I been coding. However its going to take some serious manpower to break these monsters down to where us VB common folk can get a grip on them. The website is called Karen's Power Tools the link is here : http://www.karenware.com/powertools.asp You will have to click on each individual program. Each programs page has downloadable source code, this is where you find these killer modules. Hold on to your hats because they will blow your mind !!!! Please take time to post update links on this articles page to broken down versions.
